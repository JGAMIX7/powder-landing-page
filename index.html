          Powder is a pretty expansive project at 28 tracks long. It's almost
          a double album worth of
          music. It all covers a pretty vast set of genres and moods. There
          are moments of rap,
          experimental rap, jazz, rock, and emo. On the whole, the general
          mood of the songs is
          pretty somber. Bones always has a vibe that mostly leans on lo-fi,
          cloud rap mood to his
          music. Over the course of these 28 tracks so many different things
          are presented.
          A lot of this release relies on the instrumental mood and feeling
          like a lot of Bones music.

            Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, mainly known as BONES, is an American rapper
            from Muir Beach, CA. He is the owner of underground music collective
            TeamSESH and releases music under the aliases surrenderdorothy,

          <p class="about__description">
            Although O'Connor is often considered to be one of the pioneers of
            the emo rap sub-genre, O'Connor has said that he has no specific
            genre, though has been characterized as cloud rap, experimental
            hip-hop and "shadow rap". O'Connor's earlier music is a lot more
            futuristic than his current music, which showcases production and
            vocal styles ranging from rapping, singing, and screaming. O'Connors
            singing has been compared to grunge and emo, while his rapping has
            been compared sub-genres such as horrorcore and emo rap. He is also
            considered an early pioneer of trap metal.
