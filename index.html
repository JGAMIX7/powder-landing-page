            Powder is a pretty expansive project at 28 tracks long. It's almost
            a double album worth of <br />
            music. It all covers a pretty vast set of genres and moods. There
            are moments of rap, <br />
            experimental rap, jazz, rock, and emo. On the whole, the general
            mood of the songs is <br />
            pretty somber. Bones always has a vibe that mostly leans on lo-fi,
            cloud rap mood to his <br />
            music. Over the course of these 28 tracks so many different things
            are presented. <br />
            A lot of this release relies on the instrumental mood and feeling
            like a lot of Bones music.

            Elmo Kennedy O'Connor, mainly known as BONES, is an American rapper
            from Muir Beach, CA. He is the owner of underground music collective
            TeamSESH and releases music under the aliases surrenderdorothy,
            OREGONTRAIL (with TeamSESH producer GREAF), and Ricky A Go Go.

            Although O'Connor is often considered to be one of the pioneers of
            the emo rap sub-genre, O'Connor has said that he has no specific
            genre, though has been characterized as cloud rap, experimental
            hip-hop and "shadow rap". O'Connor's earlier music is a lot more
            futuristic than his current music, which showcases production and
            vocal styles ranging from rapping, singing, and screaming. O'Connors
            singing has been compared to grunge and emo, while his rapping has
            been compared sub-genres such as horrorcore and emo rap. He is also
            considered an early pioneer of trap metal.

            Bones is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists in
            the internet's underground hip-hop scene. Since 2010, he has
            released an extensive discography and developed a large fan base. As
            of 2019, he has released over 80 albums, mixtapes and EPs across
            several aliases.

            During his childhood, he and his family moved to the small town of
            Howell, Michigan where he attended school. Eventually, he dropped
            out at the age of 16 to pursue rap music. His brother and manager,
            Elliot O'Connor, suggested Elmo come live with him in Los Angeles,
            California. There, he recorded most of his mixtapes and eventually
            met his friends Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker, people he
            eventually toured and performed with under their collective name
            SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ (though has been disbanded due to conflicts within
            the members). He is of Irish ancestry and also the grandson of actor
            Robert Culp.

            He’s known for his unique “emo rap” style of music, which is labeled
            as strictly his own, as well as the rapid rate he releases music
            (including well over 100 music videos and 50 mixtapes) and his
            resistance to joining major record labels and charging money for his
            music, despite major interest by many.
